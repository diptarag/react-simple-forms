# react-simple-forms
Simple Sign In, Sign Up forms using formik, material-ui, yup and react-router for navigation

In the 'Sign In' form - onw way of integrating formik and material ui is shown.
A better approach is then explored for 'Sign Up' form - reusable components are created using the 'useField' hook of formik.
The 'Sign In' form code can be changed to use the reusable components defined in 'VisualComponents', but it's kept to show a different approach.
